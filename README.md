Performed Convolutional Neural Network on dataset . Identified a picture is cat or dog from 1000s of images . 

# STEPS IN CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK

-> Importing the libraries

-> Preprocessing the Training set

-> Preprocessing the Test set

-> Building the CNN

-> Training the CNN

-> Making a single prediction
